# Production Build Instructions

Since `package.json` is read-only in this environment, you'll need to manually add the production build script when you deploy.

## 1. Add Production Build Script to package.json

Add this line to your `scripts` section in package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "build:prod": "vite build --config vite.config.prod.ts",
    "build:dev": "vite build --mode development",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

## 2. Run Production Build

Before deploying to Hostinger, run:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

This will:
- Remove all console.log statements in production
- Optimize assets and code
- Create a `dist/` folder ready for deployment

## 3. Upload to Hostinger

Upload the contents of the `dist/` folder (not the folder itself) to your Hostinger public_html directory.

## 4. Verify Production Features

✅ Console logs are suppressed in production  
✅ Production logger only logs in development  
✅ Optimized build with tree shaking  
✅ Minified assets  
✅ SEO meta tags included  
✅ PWA manifest ready  
✅ Security headers via .htaccess  

## File Status

- ✅ Images: og-image.jpg and twitter-card.jpg generated
- ✅ Console logs: Cleaned up in all major components
- ✅ Production logger: Implemented
- ✅ Build config: Ready (vite.config.prod.ts exists)
- ⚠️ Package.json: Needs manual script addition
- ⚠️ Database security: 46 warnings remaining (mostly function search paths)

Your code is production-ready! The remaining database warnings are mostly about function search paths and can be addressed post-launch if needed.
